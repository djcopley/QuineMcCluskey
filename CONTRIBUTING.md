## Overview
Hello and welcome to my project! If you're were looking for more rules and guidelines, you've come to the right place!

If you experience any problems please make sure that your issue is detailed. If you can include exactly what events took 
place before the failure, that is a bonus.

If you wish to contribute, simply fork this repository and make your change! When you're done and think it's ready for everyone, just submit a pull request to have your code reviewed and merged!

## Testing

When testing your changes just be cautious. All I ask is that you make sure your update doesn't break anything. Believe 
it or not it's that simple!

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/djcopley/Tiltometer/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done 
(read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Also please make sure all of 
your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes 
should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Readability is key:

  * Indent using four spaces
  * ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  * In-line comments should be preceded by two spaces `some_var = 10  # Example in-line comment`
  * Follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
  
Thank you! 😊
